VIPCommands Licence

By downloading VipCommands from Bukkit or Spigot you agree that you will not decompile the source code, claim the plugin as your
own or change the source code. 
When I release (if I release) the source code you will be able to make changes to it and claim it as your own. But until then you
are not allowed to.
Please respect these rules and thank you for downloading and using my plugin.

PS: This is not professional licence but I want to keep it short and to the point.
